# The Idea

This scaffold is going to be a template for all my educational web projects. I am trying to set default styles to all elements, using as least number of classes as possible. 

It's very opinionated, I am using my own font styles, colors and other design aspects. One of the main objectives is to achieve consistent look across all my educational porjects.

It looks super simple, because I want to focus on content and interactive snipets. It should handle all cases with common tags, have good support for markdown and unison snippets.

Below, I will just test all content and interactive elements.
